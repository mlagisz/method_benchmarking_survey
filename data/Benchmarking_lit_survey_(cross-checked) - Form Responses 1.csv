We will also add in the search term ‘HR’ (hazard ratio), which we have found in a past systematic review of prognostic models to further surface relevant studies (Rushton 2015). 
Heart failure search string: a validated heart failure filter for searching Medline using OvidSP had been previously created (Damarell 2011), and had a recall of 97.8.% from 263 out of 269 records. It uses a combination of controlled vocabulary words and free text headings. This string will form the second part of the search. The search terms alongside relevant MeSH terms will also be used.
Outcomes search string: the final part of the search string will be for outcomes. The outcomes hospitalisation and rehospitalisation will be searched as admission and readmission incorporating American‐English spelling, both of which are controlled vocabulary. Free text words will also be used for each of the outcomes in the review. HR‐QoL was searched using the acronym “Quality of Life” as it is a MeSH term incorporating HR‐QoL. The different tools (generic: EQ‐5D, SF‐12, and SF‐36 and specific: KCCQ and MLHFQ) also formed part of the outcomes search string.
Symptoms search string: the three strings (prognosis, heart failure, and outcomes) will be combined and each symptom will be searched together with the three strings. For example, dyspnoea will be searched with prognosis, heart failure, and outcomes strings. Where databases recognise MeSH headings, these will be supplemented by further descriptors for each symptom described below.
... Finally, the word 'symptom' will be searched to capture any studies which had not explicitly mentioned either of the symptoms of interest in their abstract or title, as one study was found from surveying the literature previous to the search (Alpert 2017b). The search term 'symptom*.ti' will be used so that only titles of studies are recalled.""",,,no,,,,,,,,,,yes,"The authors also would like to thank Selina Lock and Kieth Nockels, information specialists at the University of Leicester, for their assistance in reviewing the search strategy.
